# Getting started

## Quick Start

To quickly get into a working project you can just clone the prev source code.

```sh
npx degit barelyhuman/prev my-prev-project
```

Replace `my-prev-project` with whatever your project's name is supposed to be.

- You can now install dependencies

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install # (recommended)
```

- and start the dev server by running the `dev` command from npm scripts

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You now have a fully working example right it front of you. The example shows how parameterised urls are to be handled, how data is fetched and rendered. How interactivity is added etc.
